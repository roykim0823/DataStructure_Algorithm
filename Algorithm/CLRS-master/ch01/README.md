1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing
--------------------------------------------------------

## Problems

> 1-1 Comparison of running times
For each function `f(n)` and time `t` in the following table, determine the largest size `n` of a problem that can be solved in time `t`, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes `f(n)` microseconds.
